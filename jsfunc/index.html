    <div id="varDiv"><h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>
            Like many other programing languages, variables are a storage container that has a <strong>unique</strong> name.
            variables are declared using either the keyword <code>var</code> or <code>let</code>.
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/762011/whats-the-difference-between-using-let-and-var-to-declare-a-variable">
            This article</a> from StackOverflow details when you would use <code>var</code> vs. <code>let</code>.
            For this demonstration, we are going to use <code>var</code>. <br>
            The following is a list of rules you must follow when naming variables:<sup>(1)</sup>
            <ul>
                <li>Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.</li>
                <li>Names must begin with a letter</li>
                <li>Names can also begin with $ and _</li>
                <li>Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)</li>
                <li>Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following are examples of <strong>valid</strong> variable names: <code>var cit261;</code> <code>var CIT_261;</code> <code>var _C_i_T;</code>. <br>
            The following are examples of <strong>invalid</strong> variable names: <code>var 261cit;</code> (cannot begin with number) <code>var Kitty_C@T;</code> (can't use '@' symbol). <br>
            !! Don't forget that variable names are <strong>CaSe SeNsItIvE</strong> !! <br><br>
            Once we have created a variable, we can assign values to it.  We use the <strong>Assignment Operator</strong> also known as the equal sign <code> = </code>. <br>
            We can assign different types for data to a variable.  These include <strong>numbers</strong> (like 1, 256, 3.14 etc.), <strong>strings</strong> which are texts surrounded by quotes ("this is a string" or "100"),
            <strong>boolean</strong> (true or false), <strong>undefined</strong> is when a variable has been declared (i.e. <code>var x;</code>) but has not had a value assigned to it yet, <strong>null</strong> is an assigned value that means
            "no value", and <strong>object</strong> which will be talked about in another lesson.  One neat thing about JavaScript is that it is an "untyped" language.  That means that
            you don't have to tell it what type of information your variable is holding like you do in other languages such as Java or C++. <br>
            I could create a variable called "groupSize" and then assign it a value <br> <br>
            <code>var groupSize;</code><br>
            <code>groupSize = 7;</code><br><br>
            Or I could do it all on one line. <br><br>
            <code>var groupSize = 7;</code><br><br>
            Multiple variables can be declared and/or defined with a single statement. <br>
            <code>var groupSize, groupNumber, groupName;</code><br>
            <code>var groupSize = 7, groupNumber = 3, groupName = "Team 3";</code><br>
            Variables can also be assigned the value of another variable or an arithmetic value. <br>
            <code>var x = 2; var y = x;</code> <br>
            <code>var x = 8 * 8;</code><br><br>
            <strong>Scope</strong> is somthing that needs to be kept in mind when working with variables.  If a variable is declared inside a set of braces (curly brackets "{ }")
            it cannot be accessed outside of those braces, it has a <strong>local</strong> scope.  If you want a variable to have a <strong>global</strong> scope, it needs to be declared outside of a function or set of braces.
            Basically, any variable can be accessed that is inside the codeblock (set of braces) you are working in, or above it.
